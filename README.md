##### Hello my friends. My name is Евгений. Today we will talk about Agile and Scrum. Let’s go.

1. This 10 ten-minute guide will cover following: 
2. History of Agile 
3. Overview of Agile
4. WHAT IS AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT?
5. The main Agile methodologies 
6. Scrum events, Scrum team, Scrum artifacts

## 3.1 slide

The Modern-day agile methodologies were actually discovered in 2001  when a group of 17 software engineers met to discuss an alternative project management approach. 

After which Agile Manifesto was introduced. 
Following that three-day meeting, the group of 17 leaders was ready for the next chapter in the history of Agile: Convincing the world of the value of everything they laid out in the Agile Manifesto.

## 3.3 slide

### What is the Agile Manifesto?

The Agile Manifesto is a declaration of the values and principles expressed in Agile methodology. Made up for four foundational values and 12 key principles, it aims to help uncover better ways of developing software by providing a clear and measurable structure that promotes iterative  development, team collaboration, and change recognition.

### Values

1.	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2.	Working software over comprehensive documentation
3.	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
4.	Responding to change over fol’lowing a plan

###Principles

1.	Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery
2.	Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process
3.	Frequent delivery of working software
4.	Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project
5.	Support, trust, and motivate the people involved
6.	Enable face-to-face interactions
7.	Working software is the primary measure of progress
8.	Agile processes to support a consistent development pace
9.	Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility
10.	Simplicity
11.	Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs
12.	Regular reflections on how to become more effective

## 4.1 slide

Stemming from the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto, it was created as a response to the inadequacies of traditional development methods such as the Waterfall method. The software industry is a highly competitive market due to the fact that software is something that can be continuously upgraded. This means that developers need to constantly improve and innovate their products to keep on top of the game — and the linear, sequential approach of the Waterfall method just wasn’t cutting it.
## 4.2 slide

By using Agile the projects became more successfully as you can see in the statistic below.

As you can see in the statistic above, there are big improvements in the case of projects that are develop by using an Agile methodology in comparison with the projects that are developed by using Waterfall classic methodology.
## 4.3 slide

### WHAT IS AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT?

Agile aims to be clear and measurable  by using six main “deliverables” to track progress and create the product.
The deliverables
1.	Product vision statement: A summary that articulates the goals for the product.
2.	Product roadmap: The high-level view of the requirements needed to achieve the product vision.
3.	Product backlog: Ordered by priority, this is the full list of what is needed to be done to complete your project.
4.	Release plan: A timetable for the release of a working product.
5.	Sprint backlog: The user stories (requirements), goals, and tasks linked to the current sprint.
6.	Increment: The working product functionality that is presented to the stakeholders at the end of the sprint, and could potentially be given to the customer.

## 4.4 slide

The main Agile methodologies are: 
* Scrum
* Kanban
* XP (Extreme Programming)
* FDD (Feature Driven Development)
* AUP (Agile Unified Process)

 Out of the multiple frameworks discussed, Scrum is one of the most widely used frameworks which employs various processes and techniques. Scrum is an agile way to manage a project say software development; It’s a framework for getting work done, whereas agile is an attitude or a mindset. You can’t become “agile” as such, but you can always use a framework like Scrum to help you start thinking in a way that revolves around continuous improvement. Scrum assists in building agile principles into your everyday work.

Simply put, Scrum was introduced to reduce the overall risk in a software project, while also providing the value faster.

## -5 slide

In the picture above I tried to present you an overview of the entire Scrum methodology into a single diagram. You can find details about Scrum Roles, Artifacts, Ceremonies (Meetings) and Sprints (Iterations) in the next chapters.

## 5.1-5.3 slide

To start using the Scrum methodology, there are a few key roles that need to be assigned: the product owner, the Scrum master, and the development team.

#### Scrum team roles

* Product owner: Product expert who represents the stakeholders, and is the voice of the customer.
* Development team: Group of professionals who deliver the product (developers, programmers, designers).
The Scrum master removes roadblocks and facilitates handoffs where needed to keep the sprint running smoothly.

#### Scrum team Events

The Scrum framework is marked by five Events. These are the Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
* Sprint: Iterative time boxes where a goal is accomplished. Time frame does not exceed one calendar month and are consistent throughout the development process.
Sprint planning: Where the entire Scrum team get together — at the beginning of every Sprint — to plan the апˈкамин upcoming sprint.
* Daily Scrum: 15 fifteen minute time boxed meeting held at the same time, every day of the Sprint, where the previous day’s achievements are discussed, as well as the expectations for the following one.
* Sprint review: An informal meeting held at the end of every Sprint where the Scrum team present their Increment to the stakeholders, and discuss feedback.
* Sprint retrospective: A meeting where the Scrum team reflect on the proceedings of the previous Sprint and establish improvements for the next Sprint.

#### Scrum Artifacts

Artifacts are just physical records that provide project details. Scrum Artifacts include the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Product Increments.
The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features, defects, or technical work that has   yet to be worked on. It should be work that is considered valuable from the product owner’s perspective.
The Sprint Backlog is a list of all items from the Product Backlog to be worked on during a Sprint. This list is пут put together by prioritizing items from the Product Backlog until the team feels they’ve reached their capacity for the Sprint. Team members sign up for tasks in the Sprint Backlog based on skills and priorities, following the self-organizing Scrum framework.

A Product Increment is the sum of product work completed during a Sprint, combined with all work completed during previous Sprints. The goal of a Sprint is to produce a Done Product Increment. It’s up to the Scrum team to agree on what defines an Increment’s “Done” status, but all team members need to agree on and understand the definition.

## Conclusion

All in all, the agile methodologies are meant to improve software development   process, not to complicate it. Its primary benefits include helping organization release their software faster and better and for a lot less money.
